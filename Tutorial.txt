Day - 01 
* Microprocessor(MP) and Microcontroller(MC).
* An Embedded system is a Combination of MP/MC based hardware and software with some mechanical parts to perform a specific task.
* Eg: Printer, Mouse, Refrigerator.


* Program.
* A series of instructions that cause a computer or a microcontroller to perform a particular task.


* Programming languages in embedded system.
* C and C++ - Microcontrollers ( most widely used)
* Rust
* Assembly
* Java
* Python - Microprocessors, Raspberry pi, Jetsen nano


* Types of processors and controllers
* Microprocessors/ Microcontroller (8 bits/16 bits/32 bits) - WEB SIDE = Digi-Key [Dallas, Philips, Renesas, Freescale, Texas, Microchip]
* CPLD/ FPGA [Xilinx, Altera, Lattice, Actel]
* General purpose processors ( AMD processors, Pentium 4, GPU, Media GPU) (Before GPU was used for gaming applications as well as for rendering applications but today GPU is used for training for deep learning applications) [Intel, AMD, Nvidia]
* ASIC Application [Intel]
* DSP Processors ( Blackfin, Shark) [Texas, Analog Devices, Motorolla]
* SOC [Qualcomm, Broadcomm]
